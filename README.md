<h1>Network Design</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
"ECI Business" is an emerging small company with a workforce of 80 employees spread across four office buildings. The company's primary site is situated in Vancouver, with additional offices located in Calgary, Montreal, and Toronto, spanning across Canada.

To support its operations effectively, the company seeks to establish a robust network infrastructure. This infrastructure should provide reliable and secure internet connectivity between the eastern and western regions, while ensuring high availability and redundancy in Vancouver.

This project encompasses the design and implementation of a comprehensive network architecture, including aspects such as network design, IP addressing, VLAN configuration, and network security measures. By addressing each of these components, the project will demonstrate how the company's specific requirements are met in terms of connectivity, reliability, and data protection.

***********This project is constrained by a total of four routers and four switches available for implementation.***********
